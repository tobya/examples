# Headphones

This is an example configuration on how to use [Headphones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones) with Caddy.

The configuration takes following assumptions:

1. Headphones listens on port `8181`.
2. You use domain name `myheadphones.com`.
3. The Headphones http host under Settings -> Web Interface -> HTTP Host is set to `0.0.0.0`

Please be sure to change with your actual values.
